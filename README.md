This is a Ferengi Rules Of Acquisition Fortune Cookie Baker.
In other words: it outputs a random Rule of Acquisition.

I have used a website from Stephan Jacob for this program. Thanks Stephan!
His website is: http://www.sjtrek.com

No copyright infringment is intended. I have used BeautifulSoup to interpret all the rules and parse one out.
So Internet is needed. On request and when I have permission I maybe will import his text instead of using BeautifulSoup.

However this program was also intended as a exercise to using dictionaries and BeautifulSoup. 

Besides Stephan Jacob for the content, I want to thank Charles Severance for learning me how to scrape the web using Python.
He is a kickass teacher. The course is called 'Using Python to Access Web Data' and is on Coursera brought by the University of Michigan.

Remember: the bigger the smile, the sharper the knife. ;-)
